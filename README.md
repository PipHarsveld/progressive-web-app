## :fork_and_knife:Rendering choices
Client-side rendering and server-side rendering are two approaches used to display web content. With client-side rendering, the web browser requests data from the server and then uses JavaScript to generate and display the HTML. Server-side rendering, on the other hand, is when the server generates the HTML for a webpage and sends it to the client. 
There are a few pro's to using server-side rendering. It can improve search engine optimization, provide faster page loading times, and improve the user experience. By rendering the pages on the server-side, the HTML content is generated on the server and sent to the client as a complete webpage. This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done on the client-side, resulting in a faster and smoother user experience.

I implemented server-side rendering in my project using Express and Handlebars. I created a file called router.js in my router directory to render different pages.
In the router.js file, I defined different routes using the router.get() method to render the respective pages. For example, the /overview route fetches data from the Rijksmuseum API using the request() method and passes it to the overview view using Handlebars template engine. Similarly, the /details/:id route fetches data for a specific art object based on the ID passed in the URL parameter, and the /categorie/:type route fetches data for a specific art category.


## :wrench:Enhancements
<!-- This would be a good place for a list of enhancements to optimize the critical render path implemented your app  -->
- Cache-Control
- Header image verkleind
- Size bij image ophalen toegevoegd op 600 --> gevolg: niet altijd gevulde grid

## :bulb:Api
I used the Rijksmuseum API for this project and before I started, I did some research to the API. The Rijksmuseum API is a public API provided by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which allows developers to access and use data about the museum's collections. The API provides access to a large number of images and metadata for artworks, along with other information such as artist biographies and collection highlights. If you would like to know more about the API, you can visit the [Rijksmuseum API documentation](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/) or read my [research](https://github.com/PipHarsveld/rijksmuseum/wiki/Analyseren).
